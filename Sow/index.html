        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Awwwards</i> is a company who mainly organises web design
          competitions across Europe and the United States. Winners are decided
          by an industry professionals jury, which makes this award widely
          recognized in the web design world. Aside, it also provides
          educational courses of all different aspects of web design and all
          levels. <br />
          <br />
          From these awards we are going to analyze one of its competing web
          projects called <i>Grit Pictures.</i>
          <br />
          <a href="https://grit.pictures/"> Click here to see the webpage</a>
        </p>

        <h3>STRUCTURE AND VISUAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Grit Picture</i>s is a video production company. Its website is
          composed of a main page featuring the team, work, ethos and contact.
          Users can reach those sections by scrolling or by the menu located on
          the header. It's a fixed header where we can also find the business
          logo on the left side. <br />
          On almost every section we will find a round button that will take you
          to another page with all the information about that category. Each
          section works by blocks of information, mainly composed of images
          rather than text, which fits perfectly with the audiovisual company.
          It has very small margins on the right and left side, which creates a
          more chaotic visual aspect. Moreover, it has a very dark aesthetic
          full of black and white stickers and pictures.
        </p>

        <section class="column-container">
          <div class="column-1">
            <h3>INTERACTION</h3>
            <p>
              Is a vertical webpage. While scrolling, we will find some movement
              on the objects. We can differentiate a few categories from these
              moving objects along the web. <br />
              On one hand, we have the clapperboard that says
              <i>“watch me”</i> and links you to a video and the circular button
              that takes you to each section. Both of them are making little
              jumps in order to catch viewers attention and know they are
              clickable.<br />
              <br />
              On the other hand we have the images along the homepage which are
              continuously changing in order to allow viewers to look at a lot
              of images from one sanction without needing to scroll. All of them
              change from black and white to color images while hovering. <br />
              <br />
              Besides, it also has more moving objects along the webpage. Some
              elements do zooming, others turn around or change color. For
              example, one of the most interesting parts of scrolling is the
              section of
              <i>“play our showreel”.</i> While scrolling, few eye illustrations
              appear from both sides and if you continue scrolling, those eyes
              turn up in order to guide you again to the video. This is a way to
              encourage visitors to watch that video. <br />
              <br />
              Finally, all the background is full of movement, which helps the
              webpage to not get flat and gives a sense of perspective. The
              pointer is also part of this interaction, as it is in charge of
              moving a large part of the background. Although it doesn’t
              perfectly work when changing it from one section to another, it
              has some visual problems.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="column-2">
            <img src="../assets/img/web_1-ex_1.png" alt="whatch me example" />
            <img src="../assets/img/web_1-ex_2.png" alt="images example" />
            <img src="../assets/img/web_1-ex_3.png" alt="eyes example" />
          </div>
        </section>

        <h3>USABILITY</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Grit Pictures</i> website is used almost like a portfolio of the
          company. It immediately shows the whole aesthetic of their business
          without watching their videos. The page doesn’t feel very clean at the
          beginning. However, once you understand their purpose and how the
          different sections work, it’s much easier than what you expected.
          <br />
          The website is really complete and you can find all the information
          you need about the company. Moreover, in case of needing more details,
          it also includes their contact email and some links to their social
          media accounts.
          <br />
          Even though the page isn’t too large, the speed isn’t really fast.
          There are a lot of elements and it’s not really clear which elements
          are clickable and which ones are not. This is not a negative issue,
          but rather likely the intention behind the website’s creation.
        </p>

        <section class="boxes">
          <div class="box">
            <h4>SPEED</h4>
            <p>1,8s</p>
          </div>

          <div class="box">
            <h4>RESPONSIVENES</h4>
            <p>YES</p>
          </div>

          <div class="box">
            <h4>EFFICIENCY</h4>
            <p>87</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>
          As a conclusion, this webpage used to show a video business has a
          really specific style that follows the brand aesthetic. It has a
          really simple structure, however the use of images and stickers make
          it look more complex. <br />
          <br />
          In my opinion, the page looks really cool, but I had to spend quite a
          lot of time looking at how to enter each section. Most of the elements
          have some kind of movement, so they don't allow the button to stand
          out. Having found those key elements, we can see the rest of the page
          is really complete and clear.
