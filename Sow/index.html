        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Awwwards</i> is a company who mainly organises web design
          competitions across Europe and the United States. Winners are decided
          by an industry professionals jury, which makes this award widely
          recognized in the web design world. Aside, it also provides
          educational courses of all different aspects of web design and all
          levels. <br />
          <br />
          From these awards we are going to analyze one of its competing web
          projects called <i>Grit Pictures.</i>
          <br />
          <a href="https://grit.pictures/"> Click here to see the webpage</a>
        </p>

        <h3>STRUCTURE AND VISUAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Grit Picture</i>s is a video production company. Its website is
          composed of a main page featuring the team, work, ethos and contact.
          Users can reach those sections by scrolling or by the menu located on
          the header. It's a fixed header where we can also find the business
          logo on the left side. <br />
          On almost every section we will find a round button that will take you
          to another page with all the information about that category. Each
          section works by blocks of information, mainly composed of images
          rather than text, which fits perfectly with the audiovisual company.
          It has very small margins on the right and left side, which creates a
          more chaotic visual aspect. Moreover, it has a very dark aesthetic
          full of black and white stickers and pictures.
        </p>

        <section class="column-container">
          <div class="column-1">
            <h3>INTERACTION</h3>
            <p>
              Is a vertical webpage. While scrolling, we will find some movement
              on the objects. We can differentiate a few categories from these
              moving objects along the web. <br />
              On one hand, we have the clapperboard that says
              <i>“watch me”</i> and links you to a video and the circular button
              that takes you to each section. Both of them are making little
              jumps in order to catch viewers attention and know they are
              clickable.<br />
              <br />
              On the other hand we have the images along the homepage which are
              continuously changing in order to allow viewers to look at a lot
              of images from one sanction without needing to scroll. All of them
              change from black and white to color images while hovering. <br />
              <br />
              Besides, it also has more moving objects along the webpage. Some
              elements do zooming, others turn around or change color. For
              example, one of the most interesting parts of scrolling is the
              section of
              <i>“play our showreel”.</i> While scrolling, few eye illustrations
              appear from both sides and if you continue scrolling, those eyes
              turn up in order to guide you again to the video. This is a way to
              encourage visitors to watch that video. <br />
              <br />
              Finally, all the background is full of movement, which helps the
              webpage to not get flat and gives a sense of perspective. The
              pointer is also part of this interaction, as it is in charge of
              moving a large part of the background. Although it doesn’t
              perfectly work when changing it from one section to another, it
              has some visual problems.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="column-2">
            <img src="../assets/img/web_1-ex_1.png" alt="whatch me example" />
            <img src="../assets/img/web_1-ex_2.png" alt="images example" />
            <img src="../assets/img/web_1-ex_3.png" alt="eyes example" />
          </div>
        </section>

        <h3>USABILITY</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Grit Pictures</i> website is used almost like a portfolio of the
          company. It immediately shows the whole aesthetic of their business
          without watching their videos. The page doesn’t feel very clean at the
          beginning. However, once you understand their purpose and how the
          different sections work, it’s much easier than what you expected.
          <br />
          The website is really complete and you can find all the information
          you need about the company. Moreover, in case of needing more details,
          it also includes their contact email and some links to their social
          media accounts.
          <br />
          Even though the page isn’t too large, the speed isn’t really fast.
          There are a lot of elements and it’s not really clear which elements
          are clickable and which ones are not. This is not a negative issue,
          but rather likely the intention behind the website’s creation.
        </p>

        <section class="boxes">
          <div class="box">
            <h4>SPEED</h4>
            <p>1,8s</p>
          </div>

          <div class="box">
            <h4>RESPONSIVENES</h4>
            <p>YES</p>
          </div>

          <div class="box">
            <h4>EFFICIENCY</h4>
            <p>87</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>
          As a conclusion, this webpage used to show a video business has a
          really specific style that follows the brand aesthetic. It has a
          really simple structure, however the use of images and stickers make
          it look more complex. <br />
          <br />
          In my opinion, the page looks really cool, but I had to spend quite a
          lot of time looking at how to enter each section. Most of the elements
          have some kind of movement, so they don't allow the button to stand
          out. Having found those key elements, we can see the rest of the page
          is really complete and clear.

        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Webby Awards</i> are one of the most prestigious international
          recognitions of excellence on the internet. They have been presented
          by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences (IADAS)
          since 1996. They have various categories, including Websites & Mobile
          Sites; Video & Film; Advertising, Media & PR; Apps, Software &
          Immersive; Social & Games; Podcast; Creators and the latest inclusion,
          AI. <br />
          <br />
          From this competition we are going to analyze one of its participants'
          web projects called <i>Limbo.</i>
          <br />
          <a href="https://www.limbo.works/"> Click here to see the webpage</a>
        </p>

        <h3>STRUCTURE AND VISUAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Limbo</i> is a branding company. Its website is composed of a
          homepage, where it exposes some messages of empathy with the viewer,
          in order to show their solution later on. On the homepage we can also
          find some images that link us directly to their work and a footer with
          some contact information as well. <br />
          Everything is framed with a simple line that makes a square. On the
          top right of that frame we can find a menu icon with different
          sections: works; about; services; join us and citi. Most of this
          webpage is made with text, rather than images, which makes this web
          way too heavy for a branding business.<br />
          <br />
          <i> Limbo</i> is composed of three main colors: blue, white and pink.
          This is a really powerful and outstanding combination for the brand.
          Along the page, they usually use white for the background, blue for
          text and pink for the illustrations and icons. However, the footer and
          heading have a blue background with pink letters, presumably to
          differentiate them from the main page.
        </p>

        <section class="column-container">
          <div class="column-1">
            <h3>INTERACTION</h3>
            <p>
              It is a vertical webpage. This web keeps a very simple visual
              structure, however, it has very interesting movements on it. The
              first movement we can see is on the logo. While scrolling, the
              logo creates a kind of circumference, which gives the same idea as
              their isotype (a rounded door with stairs). Stairs, arches or
              circles can be seen all over the page and most of them are
              interactive objects. For example, the footer has the shape of the
              stairs and when you scroll, the stairs move upwards.<br />
              <br />
              Moreover, we can also find some illustrations that can be moved
              with the mouse pointer. They follow the main aesthetic of the
              website and some of them play with the isotype shapes as well.
              These are interactive elements added in order to counteract the
              text.<br />
              <br />
              Another interaction is made each time you change a page. For
              example, if you change from the <i>“homepage”</i> to the
              <i>“about”</i> page, an animation with the door shape is made in
              order to introduce you to the new page. This also helps users to
              know exactly when they have changed and avoid confusion.<br />
              <br />
              Finally, one of the most attractive designs for users is the mouse
              cursor. Instead of the traditional arrow, they created a hand
              pointer making the finger-pointing symbol, while also creating the
              letter “L” from limbo. Furthermore, it has a really interesting
              animation when you click. The hand snaps its fingers, which makes
              a wave that can move the interactive illustrations around it.
              Nevertheless, the cursor can sometimes be difficult to see with
              the white background due to its light colors.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="column-2">
            <img src="../assets/img/web_2-ex_1.png" alt="footer example" />
            <img src="../assets/img/web_2-ex_2.png" alt="images example" />
            <img src="../assets/img/web_2-ex_3.png" alt="eyes example" />
          </div>
        </section>

        <h3>USABILITY</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Limbo</i> serves as an informative webpage. It explains everything
          about the company and is very comprehensive. However, as a business
          that works greeting visual identities, limbo feels too explicit. They
          explain everything in detail, but users can just see how the company
          works in the work section. The rest of the page is full of text and
          doesn’t really show how this brand works.<br />
          <br />
          The web’s structure is really clear and easy to understand, which
          creates a very direct and quick interaction to find what the viewer
          wants to see.
        </p>

        <section class="boxes">
          <div class="box">
            <h4>SPEED</h4>
            <p>1,0s</p>
          </div>

          <div class="box">
            <h4>RESPONSIVENES</h4>
            <p>YES</p>
          </div>

          <div class="box">
            <h4>EFFICIENCY</h4>
            <p>ERROR</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>
          To conclude, <i>Limbo</i> has a really nice aesthetic that perfectly
          matches their brand. Their use of javascript is really good and makes
          the page more interesting. However, it doesn’t catch all viewers'
          attention because of their large explanations. In my opinion, they
          should include more visual objects and reduce text. Moreover, they
          could also include some buttons for people interested in learning more
          about the company, instead of having everything on their web.

        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
          The <i>FWA</i> is an award website that shows the most advanced
          innovations in digital design and development. It has an international
          reach, with judges from over 35 countries. They honor projects created
          by individuals; agencies and brands as well. They have different award
          categories: websites; apps; physical installations; VR and AR
          projects. <br />
          <br />
          From this site we are going to analyze a webpage done for the 18th
          anniversary of the Portuguese digital studio <i>Bürocratik.</i> The
          website is called <i>18 years of Büro.</i>
          <a href="https://18.burocratik.com/">Click here to see the webpage</a>
        </p>

        <h3>STRUCTURE AND VISUAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>
          <i>18 years of Büro</i> is a really minimalist webpage. It shows the
          story of <i>Bürocratik</i> through time. Its appearance looks like a
          timeline. It doesn’t have a menu, although a small index at the
          beginning with which you can go to a specific part of the page.
          Additionally, in the webpage also appear a little manu once you move
          forward. They divide the menu by four main chapters that are divided
          by years; they also include their social media and a link to their
          original page.<br />
          <br />
          The aesthetic is mainly in black and white, however most of the images
          are with color and some illustrations have a bit of color too.<br />
          <br />
          Its structure is based on time. So they first explain the beginnings
          of the company until 2024. It is a very long webpage full of
          information, dedicated to the <i>Bürocratik</i> team or for people
          really interested in it. Standard users are probably not going to read
          all the site, but maybe watch something specific of their interest.
        </p>

        <section class="column-container">
          <div class="column-1">
            <h3>INTERACTION</h3>
            <p>
              It is a horizontal webpage, however their responsive formats
              aren’t. <i>18 years of Büro</i> has a really simple aesthetic, but
              still has some interesting interactions all over the page. The
              first page we see and what we can call some kind of homepage has
              two main interactions: in one hand we have the background that
              moves up or down with our pointer; and in the other hand we have
              the hand that points the “Go” button, which can be moved and makes
              a comment if you make a flip with it.<br />
              <br />
              Furthermore, the main interaction that will take us through the
              entire website will be a line with a dot at its end, referring to
              a timeline. This object will be showing users the years they are
              talking about. It also moves up or downwards depending on the
              cursor.<br />
              <br />
              Another movement we can see throughout the page is with some
              images. In some parts , while scrolling starts appearing with the
              pointer trajectory. It’s interesting because this makes you stop
              and stay longer trying to watch those images that flash by quite
              fast.<br />
              <br />
              They also include some 3D elements with some interactions while
              clicking. Moreover, the pointer changes depending on the
              interaction. For example, for clickable objects, it changes to a
              hand; while for a video, it changes to two eyes to indicate
              “watch”.

        <h3>USABILITY</h3>
        <p>
          This webpage is not an ordinary page. It is used as a commemorative
          page, which means that it doesn't really have any commercial purpose,
          but rather expresses gratefulness and perhaps serves an informative
          function.<br />
          Those interested in the company will directly go to the
          <i>Bürocratik</i> official website, instead of this one. However, this
          webpage is well structured and has a lot of visual objects, which
          makes it quicker and easier to watch.

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>
          To conclude, this webpage is really interesting regarding its
          structure and different purpose. It’s really well done for all
          devices, although small screens lose the horizontal essence of the
          timeline. Maybe it could be interesting to continue with the
          horizontal webpage by turning around the display.<br />
          It’s a quite heavy website, however it doesn't have any important
          business information. Also their use of images helps a lot to keep it
          eye-catching.

        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
          <i>CSS Design Awards</i> is a design and development award platform
          that showcases digital freelance designers, studios and agencies. It's
          a very big company with international recognition. They have two types
          of judging systems: one with professional judges and another one with
          public votes.<br />
          It gives awards for each month and also a winner of the year.<br />
          <br />
          From these honors we are going to analyze one of its participants' web
          projects called <i>Seth Lukin.</i>

        <h3>STRUCTURE AND VISUAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Seth Lukin</i> is a web design studio with a really specific
          appearance. Their webpage immediately sends you to the classic video
          game world. Most of the web is made with that pixel aesthetic.
          Furthermore, the color palette is really simple, based on black, white
          and grays, which make images stand out more.<br />
          It is a really visual website, divided in different sections. At the
          beginning of the homepage they briefly explain who they are and what
          they do. Then, they immediately show their work, divided in a few
          categories: UX/UI; web; motion; visual and experimental. They
          introduce you to each work with very big images that appear while
          scrolling. You can click on them and will take you to the explanation
          of that project. However, they don’t have any sticky menu, so each
          time you go back you need to scroll down again. After this they have a
          very visual list with all the things they do and a footer with their
          contact.
        </p>

        <section class="column-container">
          <div class="column-1">
            <h3>INTERACTION</h3>
            <p>
              It is a vertical webpage. Javascript is used all over the page,
              which makes contrast with the simplicity of its colors and
              illustrations.<br />
              <br />
              We can find the first interaction on the website cover, where the
              background moves with the pointer. A boy appears jumping like the
              typical videogames characters, which already gives users an idea
              of the whole web aesthetic. If you click on that character, it
              will take you to a little game.<br />
              <br />
              Moreover, the arrow has a significant role on the web. Not just
              because of its pixelated aesthetic, but also because it changes
              its appearance depending on the object. It helps users to
              understand when something is clickable or which objects are
              videos. Really useful for objects like the videogame from the
              beginning.<br />
              <br />
              On the header we can find their mail and
              <i>linkeding</i> information instead of the typical menu. This
              produces an emphasis on getting in touch with them. It’s a fixed
              header with no background. This means that information needs to
              change color in order to stay visible in all parts. In this case,
              the information always has the opposite color of the background,
              no matter if many different colors are in the composition.This
              sometimes makes it difficult to read, although this is not a big
              problem, as we can read it in all the pages.<br />
              <br />
              Finally, another important aspect of this page is that objects
              start appearing while scrolling, but aren't until the middle of
              the viewpost when you can fully see them. This forces you to
              scroll until seeing the whole object.

          </div>
        </section>

        <h3>USABILITY</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Seth Lukin</i> is a webpage used as an introduction to this company
          work, probably as a kind of portfolio. The main objective is to show
          their works and find new clients.<br />
          As mentioned before, it is a really visual webpage, however, there is
          some missed information. They show their work and style in a very easy
          way, but don't provide any information about them, who they are, where
          they are from…<br />
          Moreover, the footer is composed of two main buttons. One for starting
          a project and the other to write an email, where the second one
          doesn’t work. In a computer it is not a problem because on the header
          it’s included their mail. However on a phone, the header only shows
          their <i>linkeding</i> information, which makes users unable to
          contact them by email. The responsive version for smaller devices
          doesn’t completely work. Some information is hidden by other objects
        </p>

        <section class="boxes">
          <div class="box">
            <h4>SPEED</h4>
            <p>14,1s</p>
          </div>

          <div class="box">
            <h4>RESPONSIVENES</h4>
            <p>BADLY</p>
          </div>

          <div class="box">
            <h4>EFFICIENCY</h4>
            <p>74</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>
          To conclude, this webpage has a very good and easy design in order to
          watch the company work and its aesthetic. It immediately involves you
          in their own world and invites viewers to see it. However, they need
          to improve the information about them, as it’s important for a client
          to know who they are going to work with, aside from their work.
          Additionally, nowadays almost everyone searches things from their
          phones, so it’s important to fix the responsiveness of the site.
